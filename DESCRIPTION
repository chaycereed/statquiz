Description: A tiny R package for practicing statistics interactively 
    inside your IDE. Generate randomized questions (ANOVA, probability, 
    more coming soon), solve them with your own R code, and check your 
    answers with immediate feedback. Designed as a lightweight tool for 
    students, instructors, and anyone wanting extra hands-on practice.
