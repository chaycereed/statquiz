\title{statquiz: Interactive statistics practice inside your R IDE}
\description{
\code{statquiz} is a small teaching and practice toolkit for statistics,
designed to be used entirely inside the R environment. You request a
randomized question with \code{\link[=question]{question()}}, solve it using real R code
(e.g., \code{aov()}, \code{t.test()}, \code{cor.test()}), and then check your work
with \code{\link[=check_answer]{check_answer()}}.

It is intended for students, self-learners, and instructors who want
hands-on practice with core statistical ideas rather than multiple
choice questions. All questions are built around real data objects
and standard R workflows.

\section{Topics}{


Currently supported topics include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{One-way ANOVA}: compare means across three groups.
\item \strong{Probability}: basic probability questions with numeric answers.
\item \strong{One-sample t-test}: test a single mean against a null value.
\item \strong{Two-sample t-test}: compare two independent groups, with
support for equal-variance and Welch-style settings.
\item \strong{Correlation}:
\itemize{
\item Pearson correlation for approximately linear, normal data.
\item Spearman rank correlation for monotonic or non-normal data.
}
\item \strong{Which test?}: scenario-based questions where you do not compute
anything, but instead choose the most appropriate test (e.g.,
one-way ANOVA, Welch's ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson/Spearman
correlation, one-sample t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank, chi-square,
Fisher's exact, equal-variance two-sample t, Welch's t, or the
Wilcoxon rank-sum / Mann-Whitney U test).
}
}

\section{Basic workflow}{


\enumerate{
\item Call \code{\link[=question]{question()}} with a topic, e.g. \code{question("anova")}.
\item Inspect the prompt and any attached data (e.g. \code{q$data}).
\item Solve the question using base R functions such as \code{aov()},
\code{t.test()}, or \code{cor.test()}.
\item Convert your result to the required answer format:
- \code{"reject"} / \code{"fail_to_reject"} for decision questions.
- A single numeric value for probability questions.
- A test label (e.g. \code{"kruskal_wallis"}) for which-test
questions.
\item Pass your answer to \code{\link[=check_answer]{check_answer()}} to see if it matches the
hidden solution.
}

\preformatted{
  library(statquiz)

  # Generate an ANOVA question
  q <- question("anova", "easy")
  cat(q$prompt, "\n")
  head(q$data)

  # Solve and check
  fit <- aov(y ~ group, data = q$data)
  p   <- summary(fit)[[1]][["Pr(>F)"]][1]
  ans <- ifelse(p < q$meta$alpha, "reject", "fail_to_reject")
  check_answer(q, ans)
}
